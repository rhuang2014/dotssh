# A pattern consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters,
# '*' (a wildcard that matches zero or more characters),
# or '?' (a wildcard that matches exactly one character).
# For example, to specify a set of declarations for any host
# in the ''.co.uk'' set of domains, the following pattern could be used:
#
# Host *.co.uk
#
# The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.[0-9] network range:
#
# Host 192.168.0.?
#
# A pattern-list is a comma-separated list of patterns. Patterns within pattern-lists
# may be negated by preceding them with an exclamation mark ('!').
# For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere within an organisation
# except from the ''dialup'' pool, the following entry (in authorized_keys) could be used:
#
# from="!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com"
#
# ForwardAgent yes
# Warning: You may be tempted to use a wildcard like Host * to just apply this setting
# to all SSH connections. That's not really a good idea, as you'd be sharing your local
# SSH keys with every server you SSH into. They won't have direct access to the keys,
# but they will be able to use them as you while the connection is established. You should
# only add servers you trust and that you intend to use with agent forwarding.
#
# BatchMode - If set to yes, passphrase/password querying will be disabled
# StrictHostKeyChecking - If this flag is set to yes, ssh(1) will never automatically add host keys
#   to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.
